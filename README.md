## Architecture

## Back-End Architecture Strategy

### Microservice Breakdown

Our back-end architecture consists of five microservices:

- **Auth**: Handles account creation, login, registration, and JWT token management. It‚Äôs kept stateless and isolated for easier scaling and security.

- **Files**: A simple file server used for uploading and serving user content (e.g., avatars). Isolated to separate heavy file I/O from core services.

- **Social**: Manages all friend-related features, chat, and notifications. Given the complexity of real-time social interactions, this service deserved its own scope.

- **Game Service (`gamesvc`)**: Runs all in-game logic and AI. It‚Äôs the only microservice that directly communicates with clients via socket.io.

- **Gateway**: Acts as a reverse proxy, routing all client traffic to the appropriate service, handling CORS, and doing token verification for protected routes.

We deliberately kept the number of services low to avoid the overhead of over-microservicing. Splitting the system into **auth**, **social**, and **game** made the most sense to us, as these are the core domains of the game.

### Communication Strategy

Most communication happens over HTTP. It‚Äôs straightforward, stateless, and easy to reason about for RESTful endpoints like login, friend requests, and file uploads.

However, two areas required WebSockets):

1. **In-Game Communication (`gamesvc`)**:

    - The client connects via Socket.io when a match begins.
    - Moves are sent to the server, and game state/emotes are pushed back in real-time.
    - This ensures low-latency interaction and a responsive game experience.

2. **Notifications (`social`)**:
    - On the main page, the client maintains a WebSocket connection to receive friend invites, challenges, etc.
    - Pushing this data avoids constant polling and improves UX.

### WebSocket accross microservices

One architectural hurdle we faced was how to emit WebSocket events to clients when the originating event came from a different microservice. Socket.io maintains a client connection in-memory, which means only the service that holds the connection (in our case, `gamesvc`) can send messages to that client.

Rather than introducing a Redis or MongoDB socket.io adapter (because additional libraries were not allowed), we found a leaner solution using MongoDB change streams:

- We enabled sharding mode and used a `notifications` collection.
- Whenever a service (like `social`) wanted to send a message to a connected client, it simply inserted a document into that collection.
- `gamesvc` listens to the collection via MongoDB‚Äôs collection subscription (change stream) feature, picks up new documents, and emits them to the correct client via socket.io.

This solution allowed us to decouple message emission from service ownership of the socket connection.
