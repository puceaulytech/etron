## Requirements

Node.js is the only requirement.

## Install

- Clone the repository
- In each project inside `services/` run `npm install` to download all the dependencies.

Note: this command should be run again every time you install/delete a package (which should not happen a lot)

## Run

In each project, run `node index.js` so the server will start listening to requests.

---

## Architecture

In the `services/` folder you will find all the projects that makes your website. Each subfolder is a node.js project
that contains:

- A `package.json` (and potentially some `node_modules`)
- An `index.js` file which is an HTTP server able to received requests
- Some logic used for the service to work correctly

---

At the start of your project, there are 2 services:

- `gateway` which is the clients' entry point. It receives all the requests and then redirect them to the correct service.
- `files` which is used to serve files. It is where your front files will go

---

To create a new service:

- Create a new folder inside `services/`
- Run `npm init -y` inside the created folder
- Create an `index.js` containing an HTTP server (and listening to a new port)
- Add any logic you want

---

To call a service:

2 external packages are allowed to transfer a request:

- `http-proxy` allows you to easily transfer a request "as-is" to another HTTP Server (you have an example in the gateway service)
- `axios` to perform specific REST requests.
